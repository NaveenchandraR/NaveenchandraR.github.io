I am Naveen Chandra, a senior student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. I am currently enrolled in the Dual (B. Tech â€“ M. Tech) Degree programme, and my research interests lie in Vision-based navigation of Autonomous Vehicles, Swarm Robotics, and Underwater Robotics.

Since the start of my undergraduate, I have been a part of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle team (AUV-IITK) at our institute. Over these years, we built two fully-functional underwater vehicles and participated at various national and international competitions Recently, we achieved the first- runners up position at the national level. My role in the team has been diverse, varying from designing and fabrication of the vehicle to working on its control architecture.  In order to improve our controller from manual PID tuning, one of my main contributions has been to do system identification for the vehicle through dynamics simulation of the vehicle underwater in ANSYS. We published the results of our work at the IEEE OES Symposium 2018 held in Porto, Portugal. Through my interactions during the conference with other research scientists working in this field, I realized the potential that autonomous vehicles carry in the future and how all these efforts seem like baby-steps to achieve a complete autonomy of these systems. Currently, we are aiming to deploy our AUV in the river Ganga to map the Dolphin population and also to monitor the sewage drainage coming into the river. This brings with a lot of new challenges compared to testing in a swimming pool, and I am now combining the results that we have got from the simulations of the vehicle dynamics and building a new controller for the vehicle.

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.  -->
